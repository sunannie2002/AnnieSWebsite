        <h2>Why I admire Michelle Kwan</h2>
        <p>
          I admire Michelle Kwan because she is an inspiration. She has
          persevered through many challenges in her life to become one of the
          most decorated figure skaters. Growing up, her family did not have a
          lot of money and immigrated from Hong Kong, so her parents worked
          multiple jobs to afford her lessons and gear. Seeing how hardworking
          her parents are, Michelle Kwan was determined to persevere and become
          a champion.
